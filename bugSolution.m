To fix the memory leak, ensure proper handling of `myString`. One approach is to check if `myString` already contains a value before assigning a new value. This prevents unnecessary object creation and potential memory leaks.

```objectivec
- (void)someMethod {
    if (self.myString == nil) {
        self.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
    }
    // ... some code ...
}

- (void)dealloc {
    self.myString = nil;
    [super dealloc];
}
```

Another solution is to use ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) feature which simplifies memory management in Objective-C.  In ARC-enabled projects, retain and release of object is handled automatically by compiler and avoids manual memory management.

To address the dangling pointer issue, avoid using `performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:` if the object might get deallocated before the delay expires. Consider using Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) or other timer mechanism which are more robust and avoids this issue. 

```objectivec
// Instead of performSelector:
dispatch_after(dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, (int64_t)(2.0 * NSEC_PER_SEC)), dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{ 
    if (self) { //Check if object still exists
      //Perform your selector here
    }
});
```
