In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regards to retaining and releasing objects.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
    // ... some code ...
}
@end
```

The issue is that if `someMethod` is called multiple times, each call creates a new `NSString` instance and assigns it to `myString`.  However, the previous instance is not released, leading to a memory leak.  The programmer might forget to handle the lifecycle of `myString` properly, such as releasing it during deallocation or when it's no longer needed.

Another issue is related to `performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:` method. If the object whose selector is performed is deallocated before the delay expires, it will lead to crashes. This is a classic example of dangling pointer.
